Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Just make little strokes like that. Imagination is the key to painting. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it.

Now then, let's play. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Every day I learn.

Let's make a happy little mountain now. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.

In your world you can create anything you desire. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. We have a fantastic little sky!

This is a fantastic little painting. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. A beautiful little sunset. Clouds are free they come and go as they please.

You can do anything your heart can imagine. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. See there how easy that is. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.

I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now.
