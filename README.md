## Approach
1. First I watched tutorials from [KirbyCasts](https://www.youtube.com/c/KirbyCasts/videos)
2. Then I copied a lot things from the [Lebkov](https://www.lebkov.nl/) project from Usability and UX Design expert [Bart van de Biezen](https://bartvandebiezen.com/nl)
3. Then I messed around a lot and read a lot in the [Kirby Cookbook](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook)
